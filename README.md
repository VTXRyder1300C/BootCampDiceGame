# BootCampDiceGame  

A Simple Game from:  
The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp  

A quick demonstartion on how to use HTML, CSS, and JS.  

The game will "roll" 2 dice each time the page is refreshed.  

HTML builds the page  
CSS styles the page  
JS does the work:  
JS will change the image based on the random number rolled.  
JS will change the H1 to show the winner or a draw based on the numbers rolled.
